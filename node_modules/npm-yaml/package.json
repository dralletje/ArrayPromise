  "readme": "\nnpm-yaml\n========\n\nYAML support for npm's `package.json`. Yes, write your dependencies in YAML.\n\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Install npm-yaml via `npm install -g npm-yaml`\n2. Set `npm-yaml` as your npm pre-hook: `npm set onload-script npm-yaml`\n\n### WTF is it doing?\n\nnpm-yaml looks for your `package.json` file and initially converts it to YAML. Afterwards, everytime you run `npm install` it will convert your `package.yml` to JSON before installing.\n\n### WTF WHY?\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. No annoying brackets\n2. JSON (in _my_ opinion) is the most ugly Object Notation language ever.\n3. I actually did this because I wanted comments in my package.json. Now I have them in my package.yml. Yay!\n\n### License\n\nLawl i have no idea about licenses. Let's just say it's **MIT licensed** although i have no idea what the hell that means.",
